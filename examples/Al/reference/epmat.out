--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open MPI's OFI driver detected multiple equidistant NICs from the current process,
but had insufficient information to ensure MPI processes fairly pick a NIC for use.
This may negatively impact performance. A more modern PMIx server is necessary to
resolve this issue.

Note: This message is displayed only when the OFI component's verbosity level is
1835727024 or higher.
